        /*NOTE: This double declrataion of `height` is not an error, but explicitly
          wanted. Mobile browser often have a dynamic UI which changes in some way
          according to user input (e.g. scrolling the page). Using `100vh` can
          result in states where the browser UI overlaps with our editors UI which
          most likely is not a behaviour we want.
          Using the `dvh` unit solves that problem by taking the browser UI into
          consideration. Downside to it being that it is fairly new and not all our
          supported browsers do support this unit. Using a double declrataions like below
          is basically a fallback to `100vh` if the browser does not support `dvh`, since
          the not-supporting will make the second `height` declaration invalid and it
          will not be applied.
