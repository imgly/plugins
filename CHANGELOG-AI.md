# Changelog - AI Plugins

## [Unreleased]

### New Features

-   [generation-web] **Input Placeholder Customization**: Added support for customizing placeholder text in input fields (e.g., prompt textarea) through the i18n translation system. Placeholders follow the same priority chain as labels:
    1. Provider-specific: `ly.img.plugin-ai-{kind}-generation-web.{provider.id}.property.{field}.placeholder`
    2. Global: `ly.img.plugin-ai-generation-web.property.{field}.placeholder`
    3. Provider defaults: `ly.img.plugin-ai-{kind}-generation-web.{provider.id}.defaults.property.{field}.placeholder`
    4. Global defaults: `ly.img.plugin-ai-generation-web.defaults.property.{field}.placeholder`
-   [image-generation] **Gemini Provider Placeholders**: Added example placeholder text to Gemini providers (GeminiFlash25 and Gemini25FlashImageEdit) demonstrating provider-specific placeholder customization

    - **Quick Action Support**: Added "Animate Between Images" quick action for creating smooth transitions between two selected images using the first-last-frame providers

## [0.2.9] - 2025-10-16

### New Features

-   [image-generation] **GeminiFlash25 Provider**: Added Google Gemini Flash 2.5 text-to-image provider via fal.ai with fast generation times, multiple aspect ratios (1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, 16:9), custom dimensions support, and multiple output formats (JPEG, PNG, WEBP)
-   [image-generation] **Gemini25FlashImageEdit Provider**: Added Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Edit provider via fal.ai for advanced image editing with multi-image support (1-10 images), comprehensive quick actions support (editImage, swapBackground, styleTransfer, artistTransfer, createVariant, combineImages, remixPage, remixPageWithPrompt), text-based editing instructions, and fast processing times

### Improvements

-   [generation-web] **Middleware preventDefault() API**: Added `options.preventDefault()` method to suppress default UI feedback (notifications, block states, console logging) when handling errors in custom middleware
-   [all] **Internationalization Support**: All hardcoded strings across AI plugins have been removed and replaced with translation keys, enabling full localization support for plugin labels, actions, styles, and error messages
-   [all] **Translation Keys Available**: Added comprehensive translation keys for:
    -   Panel and dock labels (AI Image, AI Video, AI Sticker, AI Voice, Sound Generation)
    -   Action labels (Generate Image, Generate Video, Generate Sticker)
    -   Style transfer options (None, Anime, Cyberpunk, Kodak 400, Watercolor, Dark Fantasy, Vaporwave, Vector Flat, 3D Animation, Ukiyo-e, Surreal, Steampunk, Night Bokeh, Pop Art)
    -   Error messages and UI elements
-   [all] **Backwards Compatibility**: Translation system automatically detects CE.SDK version and gracefully falls back to English strings for CE.SDK versions < 1.59.0, ensuring no breaking changes for existing integrations

### Fixed

-   [generation-web] **Placeholder Block Error State**: Fixed placeholder blocks getting stuck in Pending state when generation fails or is aborted. Blocks are now properly destroyed when generation is aborted, or moved to Error state when generation fails, preventing perpetual loading spinners in the UI.
-   [generation-web] **Middleware Block Targeting**: Fixed middleware to correctly receive block IDs for placeholder blocks and quick action targets. Previously, middleware would fall back to `findAllSelected()` which could target incorrect blocks if the selection changed during generation. Now placeholder blocks created during panel generation and target blocks from quick actions are explicitly passed to middleware, ensuring operations like pending state, locking, and highlighting affect the correct blocks.

### Changed

-   [generation-web] **BlockIds Type Refinement**: Removed unused `| null` type from `blockIds` parameter in `GenerationOptions` and `Generate` function signature. The `null` value was documented but never implemented or used. Use an empty array `[]` instead of `null` to explicitly target no blocks.

## [0.2.8] - 2025-09-29

### Fixed

## [0.2.6] - 2025-09-09

-   [video-generation] **Missing Dependency**: Added missing `@fal-ai/client` dependency to plugin-ai-video-generation-web package.json to ensure the package works correctly when installed independently

## [0.2.4] - 2025-08-07

### New Features

-   [all] **Provider Label Translations**: Added support for provider label translations
-   [all] **Extended Provider Configuration**: Added support for `history` and `supportedQuickActions` configuration fields in `CommonProviderConfiguration`, allowing customers to:

    -   Configure supported quick actions (`supportedQuickActions` field) - can disable quick actions by setting to `false`/`null`, keep defaults with `true`, or override with custom mappings and configurations
